# NeuralNetwork_LabVIEW_NumberRecognition

This repository contains a simple neural network implemented in LabVIEW that recognizes numbers from 1 to 10. The project demonstrates the basics of neural network design and training within the LabVIEW environment.

## Features

- **Number Recognition**: Capable of recognizing handwritten digits from 1 to 10.
- **LabVIEW Implementation**: Utilizes LabVIEW's graphical programming capabilities for neural network construction and training.
- **Educational Purpose**: Aimed at providing a simple and clear example of neural networks for educational purposes.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- LabVIEW 2014 or later

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/NeuralNetwork_LabVIEW_NumberRecognition.git
   cd NeuralNetwork_LabVIEW_NumberRecognition
2. Open the LabVIEW main file (nn_train.vi) in LabVIEW.

### Usage
Launch LabVIEW and open the project file (NeuralNetwork_LabVIEW_NumberRecognition.lvproj).

Open the main VI (Virtual Instrument) file.

Follow the instructions within the VI to load the training data, train the neural network, and test the recognition accuracy.
